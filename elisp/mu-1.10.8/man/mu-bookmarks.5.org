* NAME

bookmarks - file with bookmarks (shortcuts) for mu search expressions

* DESCRIPTION

Bookmarks are named shortcuts for search queries. They allow using a convenient
name for often-used queries. The bookmarks are also visible as shortcuts in the
mu experimental user interfaces, =mug= and =mug2=.

The bookmarks file is read from =<muhome>/bookmarks=. On Unix this would typically
be w be =~/.config/mu/bookmarks=, but this can be influenced using the ~--muhome~
parameter for *mu-find(1)*.

The bookmarks file is a typical key=value *.ini*-file, which is best shown by
means of an example:

#+begin_example
[mu]
inbox=maildir:/inbox                  # inbox
oldhat=maildir:/archive subject:hat   # archived with subject containing 'hat'
#+end_example

The *[mu]* group header is required. For practical uses of bookmarks, see
*mu-find(1)*.

#+include: "author.inc" :minlevel 1

#+include: "copyright.inc" :minlevel 1

* SEE ALSO

*mu(1)*, *mu-find(1)*

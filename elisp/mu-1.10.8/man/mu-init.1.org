* NAME

mu init -- initialize the mu message database

* SYNOPSIS

*mu [common-options] init [options]*

* DESCRIPTION

*mu init* is the subcommand for setting up the mu message database. After *mu init*
has completed, you can run *mu index*

* INIT OPTIONS

** -m, --maildir=<maildir>
starts searching at =<maildir>=. By default, *mu* uses whatever the *MAILDIR*
environment variable is set to; if it is not set, it tries =~/Maildir= if it
already exists.

** --my-address=<my-email-address>

specifies that some e-mail addresses are 'my-address' (the option can be used
multiple times). Any message in which at least one of the contact fields
contains such an address is considered a 'personal' messages; this can then be
used for filtering in *mu-find(1)*, *mu-cfind(1)* and *mu4e*, e.g. to filter-out
mailing list messages.

=<my-email-address>= can be either a plain e-mail address (such as
*foo@example.com*), or a basic PCRE regular-expression (see *pcre(3)* for details),
wrapped in */* (such as =/foo-.*@example\\.com/=). Depending on your shell, the
argument may need to be quoted.

** --reinit

reinitialize the database from an earlier version; that is, create a new
empty database witht the existing settings. This cannot be combined
with the other ~init~ options.

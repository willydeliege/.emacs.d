* NAME

mu view - display an e-mail message file

* SYNOPSIS

mu [common options] view [options] <file> [<files>]

* DESCRIPTION

*mu view* is the *mu* command for displaying e-mail message files. It works on
message files and does =not= require the message to be indexed in the database.

The command shows some common headers (From:, To:, Cc:, Bcc:, Subject: and
Date:), the list of attachments and the plain-text body of the message (if any).

* VIEW OPTIONS

** --summary-len=<number>
instead of displaying the full message, output a summary based upon the first
=<number>= lines of the message.

** --terminate
terminate messages with \\f (=form-feed=) characters when displaying them. This is
useful when you want to further process them.

** --decrypt
attempt to decrypt encrypted message bodies. This is only possible if *mu*
was built with crypto-support.

** --auto-retrieve
attempt to retrieve crypto-keys automatically from the network, when needed.
